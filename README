REDMINE MEDIAWIKI FORMATTER
(c) 2010 Phil Gengler

WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
This is a Redmine plugin that adds Mediawiki syntax as a wiki format.
Mediawiki is the engine that powers sites like Wikipedia, so the syntax may
already be familiar to a number of users.

HOW DO I USE THIS?
------------------
You will need to have the 'mediacloth' Ruby gem installed; this gem handles
the actual parsing.

Then:
(1) Copy the plugin directory into the Redmine vendor/plugins/ directory
(2) Start/restart Redmine
(3) In Redmine, go to "Administration" and choose "Settings"
(4) Change the value of the "Text formatting" dropdown to "mediawiki"

CREDITS
-------
* Larry Baltz, whose redmine_markdown_formatter plugin was the inspiration to
  create this, and who credited:
* Yuki Sonoda (http://github.com/yugui) did the real work by creating the
  redmine_rd_formatter
* Jean-Philippe Lang for making the change to RedMine (based on Yuki's patch) to
  allow pluggable formatters

FUTURE PLANS
------------
* Gracefully handle parse errors
